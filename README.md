# Exo-Planet-detection

### Main Contribution and novelty of the research-
  
  This research makes a significant contribution to the accurate classification of exoplanets
by exploring and applying various machine learning and deep learning techniques. The focus
is on the NASA Kepler dataset, and the study follows the systematic Knowledge Discovery in
Databases (KDD) methodology. The methodology includes data collection, exploratory data
analysis (EDA), preprocessing, feature selection, and model evaluation. The primary
objective is to examine the effectiveness of machine learning and deep learning models in
detecting two distinct classes of exoplanets: false positives and confirmed ones. The dataset
includes 49 columns and 9546 rows and is directly obtained from NASA's Kepler mission.
Through extensive exploratory data analysis, the study gains insights into the dataset's
characteristics and addresses challenges such as missing values and diverse data types.

  The research includes preprocessing and transformation in the data layer, model training
in the business logic layer using both machine learning and deep learning models, and an
evaluation layer to assess model performance. Python and libraries are used for practicality
and efficiency. This study evaluates various models and techniques for feature selection to
enhance the data preprocessing stage. The research highlights the significance of feature
selection in enhancing model accuracy and demonstrates the effectiveness of CatBoost and
XGBoost in achieving impressive results. The study also explores the use of deep learning
models, including the unconventional use of the Variational Autoencoder for binary
classification. The study concludes with a comprehensive evaluation of each model's
performance and provides detailed insights through confusion matrices, classification reports,
and learning curves. Overall, this research contributes significantly to the ongoing quest for
accurate exoplanet detection by offering a nuanced understanding of the strengths and
limitations of various machine learning and deep learning approaches. The combination of
traditional machine learning models with advanced deep learning architectures, coupled with
a meticulous exploration of preprocessing and feature selection techniques, makes this
research a valuable resource for researchers and practitioners in the field of exoplanet
classification.
